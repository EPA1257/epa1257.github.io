Unknown title of work involving aliens (2019)
My good friends at gr18vidz14kidz were planning to start a magazine or something like that, and I submitted a writing + drawing. Unfortunately the project never came to fruition and I cannot even remember what the title of this story was. The only thing I do remember is that it involved aliens, and was written intentionally poorly so as to emulate a story that a child might write (like an ironic Mr. Hungry). I swear I backed it up at some point but my search efforts have been fruitless. I certainly remember that I did write it, at least. Unless it was a dream...
