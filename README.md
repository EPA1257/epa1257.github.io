#### Welcome to Kait Bell's home on the world wide web. Thanks for joining me here.


Some parts of this website are intended to be viewed on browsers that support HTML+TIME, such as Internet Explorer 5.5.

All of it should be viewable on any modern browser (Chromium, Firefox) without much issue.

Also, this site is open source if you care about that sort of thing.

Thank you for visiting this GitHub page, and have a very pleasant day! ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPA1257/epa1257.github.io/master/index.files/happy.png "Smiley Face")
