#### Occasional Internet Home of "Kait Bell"?


This site is intended for elaborate projects of mine involving website editors, artificial intelligence, game creation suites, and general art stuff.

As such, the website is a constantly-changing mess.

Despite running on https as all GitHub things do, I've coded most parts of the website with minimal HTML tags to make it viewable on as many web browsers as possible with low speed turnarounds.

Some sections of the site, specifically the You Will Hate This section, utilize PHP and more complicated/later-version HTML tags.

If all of this sounds very intimidating, I strongly suggest visiting one of the following websites as an alternative:

Thank you for visiting this GitHub page, and have a very pleasant day! ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EPA1257/epa1257.github.io/master/index.files/happy.png "Smiley Face")
