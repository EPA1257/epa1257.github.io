Negative Extinct Tire Show is a show where I see how long it takes for you to turn it off.
It will be a cult classic as soon as the first season has ended, then it will slowly drop off
as a major network picks it up for 4 more seasons before dropping it halfway through the third.
Later, it will be released on DVD and Blu-ray in a limited edition box set that includes a
plush toy of your choosing. Everyone will then forget about it, as they should.
With cinematography the likes of which you have possibly seen before, and guaranteed network interference
in every episode, you will certainly cry as you continue to watch this garbage heap.
Have you ever wanted to spend 8,000 Japanese yen just by watching a television show? Negative Extinct
Tire Show is certainly not for you, then. I might make you spend 8,000 American dollars, though.
And because I'm feeling so nice today, maybe I'll throw in a meal with fries and a soda. As you watch
the show, I want you to think of answers to the following questions: 1. Are you enjoying the show?
2. What is more likely to be under your bed at night: a man, or a mouse? 3. What religion seems funky today?
4. What time will it be in Myanmar in 4 hours? 5. Have you called 911 for any reason? When you are finished
answering these questions, think about them for an hour, then take a cold bath. Do not tell anyone about
your answers under any circumstances, including the police or your family friend that sleeps in the guest room.
Before watching the show, please make sure you have a stamp on your hand to indicate that you are, indeed,
one of us. If you don't have this stamp, we ask you politely to go away now. No pets allowed yet, but
we may reconsider if you give us at the very least all of your belongings. Please watch the show.
