<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>

<P class=MsoNormal>added Jul 15:</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Mister Blanks Delusional Fantasii</B>. Recorded May 
2025.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>While this started as a recording experiment, and is 
mixed/mastered to my liking, I will be redoing this one for various reasons.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 6pt" size=1>8/6/25 note - I hate 
thinking about this song. just the lyrics really. Maybe u will know why one day. 
it will be on the record nonetheless...&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Demo Three</B>. Recorded June 2025.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>slightly edited (sorry), for "better" listening 
experience</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 6pt" size=1>8/6/25 note - this song 
got a title.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Tonally Nothing</B>. Recorded July 2025.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>* <I>This will not be on the album</I>.&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>This is a&nbsp;nothing, it will not be on the final record. 
Just felt like it should be recorded and subsequently "out there". Maybe itself 
is "out there".&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Simple Simon I Think</B>.&nbsp;Recorded 
July&nbsp;2025.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The ending thing will sound better eventually.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 6pt" size=1>8/6/25 note - this song 
got a new title. but i wont tell u what it is!!! HA!!!!&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal>added Aug 6:</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Medley: Mr Blank &amp; Someone</B>. Recorded August 
2025.<BR>This is a medley rehearsal of Mister Blank's Delusional Fantasy and 
"Someone", two songs that will be on the record.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Copy Girl</B>. Recorded August 2025.<BR>* <I>This will not 
be on the album</I>.<BR>This is a cover of a song by COCA, whose real name is 
Yoshiko Hada. Today she is well known as a painter, but not many people know she 
was a musician who was involved with the Japanese indie scene until 1999. She 
was an original member of indie trio <I>ELEKKI BRAN </I>which is how I found out 
about her.<BR>In the 90s she released some music under this pseudonym and then 
quietly disappeared. I don't know if they really made a dent in the scene at the 
time, I can't find any articles or anything, but the songs are incredible. 
Offbeat pop? nah that feels like a misnomer. It's something. Something crazy 
about these songs, and her only full length album PULSE.<BR>I have cried to Copy 
Girl many times. I dont think Im too ashamed to admit that now, but if i said it 
at the time, I feel like I would have been laughed at, probably not. Really its 
a simple song but those lyrics cryptic as they are, describe a part of me i like 
to pretend to repress. It is a song I live through every day of my life.<BR>I 
wanted to learn to play this song, but in my mind this song wouldnt fit well 
with the theme of this album. But I wanted to pay tribute to what is a very 
important song for me, and one that sparked the creation of my new world of 
songwriting. Thanks Hada-san.<BR>Japanese is still a language I struggle with. I 
can now understand it better than French. A blessing and a curse. My 
pronunciation is not good, very Canadian. Please keep that in mind. The lyrics 
are on Genius if you want to read/translate them.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Demo Three - Vocal try</B>. Recorded July 2025.<BR>Even 
though this song now has a title, I will still call it Demo Three. This is an 
acapella ver. Why Not!</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><BR><B>"Someone" vocal demo &amp; songwriting session</B>. 
Recorded July 2025.<BR>This is the vocal demo of a song called "someone" - the 
actual title of the song is longer, ok? - a cool little short thing that 
originally ended before the 'Savagely' line. listen to the medley to get an idea 
of the instrumental structure as it stands right now. when I tried to record 
bass for this song i found out my bass is broken, how fun, I guess I need to fix 
that!!!<BR><I>0:00 - 1:15 </I>- I'm figuring out the melody<BR><I>1:16 - 2:22 
</I>- the songwriting process in action, minus a LOT of silence. You are hearing 
the ending being written, the words being formed from my mouth for the first 
time. The tapping is me writing it down in my notes app. 
<I>Exciting</I>.<BR><I>2:23 - end </I>- Pretty much the final melody/lyrics 
(except for a few changes).<BR>After this, I figured out the chords (thanks Guy 
for helping with that!).</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Early demo that will never be finished</B>. Recorded July 
2025.<BR>* <I>This will not be on the album</I>.<BR>This is actually a 
combination of a vocal demo and bass rehearsal. I realized that I have no idea 
how to play the chord(s) I was trying to play so I've abandoned this one at 
least for the time being. As mentioned above I found out my bass is broken so I 
can't plug it into an amp/the mixer at the moment anyway.<BR>In addition, the 
lyrics that this melody was originally intended for didn't really fit well, so I 
wrote a new one, unfortunately much simpler, but it still sounds alright. I had 
this song in mind for a single or something, but that will be decided when 
everything is mixed 'n' mastered to my liking.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Someone Tell Me If I Said This Already</B>. Recorded May 
2025.<BR>Here is another recording experiment from the early idea germination. I 
might redo this one. I go back and forth hating it and loving it.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So, total progress report - about ~15 minutes have been 
recorded for the record as of today. That's pretty good. My target is about 40 
total, if it's above or below, no worries.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>It'll be done when its done of course. I would estimate by 
the end of the year or early next year, if I can keep up this 
pace.</P><BR><IFRAME id=djgk title="demo jigoku"
