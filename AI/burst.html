  <b>The Fucking Hate You: Bursting Out of My Skin</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fucking Hate You does not exist. It never has and never will.
  <br>
All of the music created by The Fucking Hate You was created using <a href="http://maciej.codeminion.com/2008/05/cgmusic-computers-create-music/">cgMusic by Maciej Biedrzycki</a> - a Windows program that creates compositions using random number generation and preset rhythms/melodies.
  <br>
The idea for The Fucking Hate You's album was inspired heavily by the themes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7SQ5Zi5E8s">Today is the Day's "Sadness Will Prevail"</a> (Relapse Records, 2002).
