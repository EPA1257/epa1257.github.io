<b>Welcome to my website. A fair warning before you proceed:</b>
<br>
This site is intended for elaborate projects of mine involving website editors, artificial intelligence, game creation suites, and general art stuff.
<br>
As such, the website is a constantly-changing mess.
<br>
Despite running on https as all GitHub things do, I've coded most parts of the website with minimal HTML tags to make it viewable on as many web browsers as possible with low speed turnarounds.
<br>
Some sections of the site, specifically the You Will Hate This section, utilize PHP and more complicated/later HTML tags.
<br>
If all of this sounds very intimidating, I suggest visiting one of the following, nicer laid-out sites as an alternative:
