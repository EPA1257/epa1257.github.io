       <span class="ContentBox">Full album title: You will hate this. You will say, "Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!" And you may be right. It's probably not that good. Besides, this translation is bad. I used Google because I can't speak Japanese.&nbsp;<br /><br />An idea that has recently re-entered my brain is movie sound - it's one of those things that changes all the time and yet always seems to be the same. We associate the movies with their sounds - loud, booming bass during action sequences, the quiet seconds in a horror movie when you can hear everyone in the theater becoming tense - it's one of the most important parts of a film, and it literally surrounds you as you watch. In the 90's-00's, the home theater setup became cheaper and more popular than ever. My family saved up for and eventually invested in a home theater when I was around 7 years old, and hearing a theater-like experience in the home was absolutely mindblowing. Unfortunately, due to really cheap components in the system, it eventually failed and we bounced to a regular ol' Blu-ray player with 2 channel audio in 2016. It wasn't until 2019 when I was in a thrift store and found a Yahoo (yes, that Yahoo) branded home theater system for a 20 dollar asking price. After setting it up and experiencing this phenomenon again, I began to get interested in how surround audio worked.<br /><br />Flash back a couple decades - remember Quadraphonic audio? If you don't, it was a kind of proto-home theater in a sense, except audio only - and on vinyl. Unfortunately, it never took off outside the audiophile market, which is pretty small anyway. I can't say much more about Quad because I haven't experienced it in person, but I could probably liken it to the home theater experience.<br /><br />Anyways, here's where this is going: Quad is expensive, but a home theater is (now) pretty cheap. This technique isn't exactly new or anything*, but the idea is: what if I were to make a full length recording using the generally available 5.1 surround system and make a burnable .ISO file available to those who wanted such a thing? And that is what I have set out to do, with musical genius and 90's-alt-rock-fan-trapped-in-2020 Guy Kesnick along for the ride.<br /><br />This album costs absolutely NOTHING, but we appreciate your support if you choose to do that.&nbsp;<br /><br />*[insert tangent about DVD-Audio/BD-Audio and how it was used by Flaming Lips, Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, etc. but is generally unpopular today]<br /></span>
